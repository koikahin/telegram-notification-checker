write an android app that can intercept native android notifications using kotlin and latest android technology that you are trained to use. 

the app is fairly straightforward:
1. the app needs to intercept notifications from another app (and only from that app)
2. it should read the notification contents, and if the notificaion content matches certain regular expression, raise a notification "slots were found". 
3. if the other app's notificaion doesn't match the pattern, that other app's notification needs to be dismissed. if the notification matches the pattern, that other app's notification shouldn't be dismissed. 

ask any clarifying questions before proceeding. 

write a plan.md file with the plan to implement this feature. once i read the plan.md and give you a go ahead, go ahead and do the implementation according to the plan.
